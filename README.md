# PickUp-Games
## A message board for upcoming pickup games

PickUp games serves as a message board where users can make posts for upcoming pick up games they are having.  Along with that, users can choose
to attend pickup games so that there is a head count before the game even begins.  Users can also get updates when a game is created for a
specific sport, so that they are always up-to-date on where games are happening.
